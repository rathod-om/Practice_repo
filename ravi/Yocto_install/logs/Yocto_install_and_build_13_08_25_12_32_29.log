You are about to install the SDK to "/home/omrathod/yocto/poky/buildtools". Proceed [Y/n]? Y
Extracting SDK..................done
Setting it up...done
SDK has been successfully set up and is ready to be used.
Each time you wish to use the SDK in a new shell session, you need to source the environment setup script e.g.
 $ . /home/omrathod/yocto/poky/buildtools/environment-setup-x86_64-pokysdk-linux
INFO: Setting up the environment
INFO: Testing installation
INFO: Installation successful. Remember to source the environment setup script now and in any new session.

### Shell environment set up for builds. ###

You can now run 'bitbake <target>'

Common targets are:
    core-image-minimal
    core-image-full-cmdline
    core-image-sato
    core-image-weston
    meta-toolchain
    meta-ide-support

You can also run generated qemu images with a command like 'runqemu qemux86'

Other commonly useful commands are:
 - 'devtool' and 'recipetool' handle common recipe tasks
 - 'bitbake-layers' handles common layer tasks
 - 'oe-pkgdata-util' handles common target package tasks
